# Express App Scaffold with EJS

This project serves as my re-usable scaffold for whenever I roll a new Express app. It has the following base set up, ready to use:

- `bin/www` set and configured
- `app.js` initial setup
- `routes/` with a sample home page
- `views/` with a sample home page using EJS
- `public/` for serving client side assets
- Other items like `.gitignore`, `.jshintrc`, `.travis.yml`, etc.

Chai and Mocha are included in `package.json` too (remember, test driven development üòá), along with two Express specific items, such as `helmet` and `body-parser`.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
- Re name it accordingly
- Remove this `.git` directory, add your own
- Replace this `readme.md` with your own
- `cd` to the project, then `npm i`
- `npm start` and then visit localhost:3000

Feel free to share, fork, clone -- whatever! üçª
